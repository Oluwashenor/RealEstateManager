# Db Context Factory

When you run any Entity Framework Core migration command (such as Add-Migration in Package Manager Console or dotnet ef migrations add in .NET CLI), these commands need an instance of your DbContext to work with the database. In a typical application, the DbContext is created and configured through dependency injection at runtime, often in the Startup.cs file of your application.

However, during design-time operations like running migrations or other tools (when there is no runtime environment or dependency injection available), Entity Framework Core uses the IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<TContext> implementation you provide to create an instance of your DbContext. This factory method provides the necessary configuration for EF Core tools to perform tasks like creating migrations, updating the database schema, etc.

So, to reiterate, the IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<TContext> interface allows you to create a specific instance of your DbContext at design time, separate from the runtime configuration, to support EF Core tools and commands. This helps decouple the design-time operations from the runtime services and configurations of your application.
